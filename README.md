# Jailbreaking Bad

![Logo](https://scr.infinum.co/adis/3x_60pt.png)

This is just a simple app companion to a blog post regarding jailbreak security found here:

[https://infinum.co/the-capsized-eight/jailbreaking-bad](https://infinum.co/the-capsized-eight/jailbreaking-bad)

The app has only one button, and some basic checks to detect if the device the app is on is jailbroken or not.

Jailbreak detection methods used can be found here: [https://github.com/thii/DTTJailbreakDetection](https://github.com/thii/DTTJailbreakDetection)
